    <h2>Week 2</h2>

    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>

    <p>When first opening the website the immediate feature that caught my attention was the usage of interaction from the mouse moving across the website and how it created a strange effect akin to dropping a small object in a body of water, as well as the sound that was being produced each time I moved the mouse.</p>

    <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Upon first opening the experience I moved the mouse around the artwork which began to manipulate the artwork.</li>
      <li>I then expanded the mouse size setting to 0.06 in the controls panel, which further distorted the background and sounds being generated when I moved the mouse again.</li>
      <li>I then moved the speed / vibrato amount up to 6 which upon I then moved around the mouse to help create a disorientating effect in terms of both sound and visuals.</li>
      <li>Then finally I moved the settings for gleams up to 2.86 which further added to the disorientating effect being produced, and appeared to increase the lighting being produced by moving around the mouse.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

    <p>The speed / vibrato amount that was featured in the controls panel was the feature I spent the most amount of time with.</p>

    <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>

    <p>Simply moving around the mouse across the screen was definitely the key aspect of my experience, as the key characteristic of the experience was the implementation of movement and interactivity.</p>

    <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

    <p>The impression I got from the experience was that manipulation and interactivity were the key characteristics that defined the work. The implementation of the controls panel and the usage of the mouse as the key way to interact with the work were two examples of this.</p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

    <p>The usage of colour, as seen with the purple bars that make up the parameter settings in the control panel, help to indicate to the user the primary goal of experimenting from changing these settings. To further help the user, a message appears at the bottom to indicate towards the control panel.</p>

    <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>

    <p>It appears that the experience should be fully interacted up until the point all possible ideas could be generated from playing around with the controls panel and seeing the effects that can be generated from this for both the audio and visual aspects of the artwork.</p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>

    <p>The controls panel on the side of the website help to indicate to the user that the main experience featured on this website should be manipulated and experimented with over time in order to experience the artwork to the fullest extent.</p>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>

    <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

    <p>One media form that comes to mind immediately is the video game Super Mario 64, particularly in the parts of the game where you have to jump into the paintings to enter new worlds. The way you jump into these paintings produces a similar wobbly effect and features its own soundtrack to it as well.</p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

    <p>This reference communicates the idea of jumping into a new experience and seeing new ideas being created from interacting with these various pieces and features.</p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

    <p>As mentioned before, the process of experiencing and changing through each interaction is key characteristic of engaging with this research experience, so the feeling of excitement comes into mind when best trying to describe this.</p>

    <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

    <p>Though there are many options to experiment with and manipulate, I feel as if the usage of a simple background image makes the process of playing around with the settings feel somewhat stale after a while. Another frustrating part of this process, whilst not a major factor for myself, is the seemingly endless possibilities could be described as intimidating to try and go through when interacting with this work.</p>

    <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>

    <p>Distorting the artwork to help generate the sounds was oddly satisfying, as it felt as if I was creating an entirely new piece of audio each time I moved around the page.</p>
